# Scoping

- Go through the designs and pitch and document todos.
- Group todos into scopes based on vertical slices. How we can build, test, and deliver each individually in a few days a piece.
- Identify the Spotlight Scope. Which scope is the most critical to work on.
- Sequence scopes in the order the team will work on them.
- Run through the project scope by scope to see if it fits within the appetite.
