# Scoping

## Members
Whole Team

Prep: [Create Basecamp Project](https://www.notion.so/companycam/Cycle-Setup-221ad631b5a34e3e8e8302e53b03e1f8)

Steps:
- Go through the designs and pitch and document todos.
- Create todos for the whole project end to end
- Group todos into scopes based on vertical slices. How we can build, test, and deliver each individually in a few days a piece.
- Sequence scopes in the order the team will work on them.
- Identify the Spotlight Scope. Which scope is the most critical to work on.
- Run through the project scope by scope to see if it fits within the appetite.

Success: Every step of the project organized in sequential manageable chunks

Questions:
- What are we missing?
- How are we being unrealistic?
