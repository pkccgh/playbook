Question it has to answer: What should we build to satisfy the Frame?

[Official Pitch Template](https://www.notion.so/companycam/Official-Pitch-Template-99f00930ae6d4736ab64db37106371c6)

- Prep: Clone the Pitch Template and include the frame
- During: Identify the solution (the what) that we would like to build and
document why it is the correct choice
- Success: A clearly defined solution section to the Pitch. A clear narrative on
why it was chosen. Broad enough strokes to allow the team to identify how.

Questions?
- Does this solution fufill the Frame?
- Does this solution fit in our appetite?
- Does this solution address the constraints?
- Is this the right thing to build?
