## Members

Product Quartet (Product, Design, Engineering, QA)

## Prep

 - Clone the [Pitch Template](https://www.notion.so/companycam/Official-Pitch-Template-99f00930ae6d4736ab64db37106371c6) and include the frame


## Purpose

- A clearly defined solution section to the Pitch
- A clear narrative on why it was chosen
- Broad enough strokes to allow the team to identify how

## Steps

- Identify the solution (the what) that we would like to build
- Document what and why it is the correct choice

## Questions

- Does this solution fufill the Frame?
- Does this solution fit in our appetite?
- Does this solution address the constraints?
- Is this the right thing to build?
